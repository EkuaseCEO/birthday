          Wishing you the happiest of birthdays, superstar! You continue to blow us away with your talent, but today, we’re celebrating YOU, the amazing person behind the characters we all adore! If Nollywood had a “Best All-Around Awesome Human” award, I’m pretty sure you’d win it every year King.
          
          May this year bring you more laughs, unforgettable moments, and maybe even some new roles that’ll make us say, “How did he pull that off?!” Keep shining both on-screen and off, and may you always find joy in every step of your journey. 
          
          Praying for your health, happiness, and endless blessings and a year full of new adventures, big wins, and plenty of cake & love! May every role you take on be as amazing as your heart is, and may your days be as bright as your smile on screen (which is pretty bright, by the way!). Keep being the incredible soul you are. Happy birthday, Maurice! Enjoy every moment of your special day!

            One day I came across an interview with u that dates back 5 or 6 years. At that moment, I knew you were self-taught in acting and you earned my respect and admiration. You have worked and still work hard to perfect your acting. Every Tuesday on Maurice Sam TV, I discover a new facet of your acting talent. You are my most beautiful discovery of 2024 my talented actor (I often say when we define talent we must put your name as an example).
            I’m so happy to be part of your family MS.
            
            Today is your birthday, we are happy to have once in the year the opportunity to express our love to u and much happier to know u will read us. One thing I know for sure is that you are as proud of us as we are of you. Just know that you don’t just have simple fans but u have an army of people who pray for you cause we love to see you win.

            Happy birthday, Maurice Sam. It's been an absolute delight to watch you hone your craft over the years. I've been watching you since Hotel Majestic, yes I'm an OG fan, lol. You just keep getting better and better with every production and it's an honour to be a part of your fanmily. 

            Your body of work helped me get through a pretty rough 2024, and I must say you are the consummate professional, and I absolutely love your films. I am so proud of all you have achieved, and I pray that you will attain even greater heights this year and beyond. 
            
            May the good Lord keep blessing you, may He cause His face to shine on you and give you peace. May He grant you all your heart's desires and shower you with His endless grace and favour. May lines fall for you in pleasant places, and may your star continue to shine far above your peers.
