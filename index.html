            Happy birthday, Maurice Sam. It's been an absolute delight to watch you hone your craft over the years. I've been watching you since Hotel Majestic, yes I'm an OG fan, lol. You just keep getting better and better with every production and it's an honour to be a part of your fanmily. 

            Your body of work helped me get through a pretty rough 2024, and I must say you are the consummate professional, and I absolutely love your films. I am so proud of all you have achieved, and I pray that you will attain even greater heights this year and beyond.

May lines fall for you in pleasant places, and may your star continue to shine far above your peers.

            You may not know me but I am your biggest fan. I am like the stars in the galaxy admiring your hard work, charisma and zeal to push every dream of yours to success.  You‚Äôre an inspiration to many and your legacy shall never die. You‚Äôre a born star, a hero and a leader. As you celebrate your birthday, May good health be your shield and may every prayer you have ever prayed be answered in multiple folds. May your life be as a fountain overflowing to every member of your household, and may you never run out of any perfect gift of life. You deserve this and many more.
